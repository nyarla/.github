Support
=======

This documentation is a guideline about support for my software or libraries.

For all
-------

I have not always respond to your contact by some reason.
For examples:

- I have down time by mental disorders (Clinical Depression)
- I have no times for writing English message (I'm not native English speaker)
- Time zone difference (I'm living in Japan. this time zone is `+09:00`)

And I use my e-mail address for private things.
If you'd like to respond your message from me, you should send message by public internet services (ex. Twitter or GitHub)

For developers
--------------

My projects includes software or libraries provies "AS IS", I don't guarantee to provide any kind of support.

If you would like getting supports by me, you could select these actions:

- Report your problems or your found bugs via GitHub Issue
- Send feature request via GitHub Issue 
- Or make pull request and send to my project repository

But, yet I don't guarantee to any kind of support.
This thing includes no responses, no actions, or do nothings to your any reports.

If you think "this project does not have active development" to my projects, **your best is fork it**.
I'm always welcome to fork my project under the respect of original licenses.

For non-English speakers
------------------------

**Please send message to me by English!**

In GitHub, English is defact standard language to communications.
And if you don't use English, **I can't read and respond your problem or bug reports**.

If you can't use English as native speakers, you don't need about afraid to use English.
We can use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [Google Translate](https://translate.google.co.jp/).
In the fact, this documentation checked meaning of English by DeepL.

For recruiter about jobs
-------------------------

I got recruiting e-mail sometimes.
But **you should not send me any kind of job recruiting e-mail**. 

I already say "I have down time by mental disorders".
**It's biggest blocker for assign jobs to me**.

I can't join to your projects or companies by this reason at current time.
